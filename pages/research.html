                <p><u>Abstract:</u> Wireless communication between an unmanned
                    aerial vehicle (UAV) and the ground base station (BS) is suscep-
                    tible to adversarial jamming. In such situations, it is important
                    for the UAV to indicate a new channel to the BS. This paper
                    describes a method of creating spatial codes that map the chosen
                    channel to the motion and location of the UAVs in space, wherein
                    the latter physically traverses the space from a given so called
                    “constellation point” to another. These points create patterns
                    in the sky, analogous to modulation constellations in classical
                    wireless communications, and are detected at the BS through a
                    millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensor. A constellation point
                    represents a distinct n-bit field mapped to a specific channel,
                    allowing simultaneous frequency switching at both ends without
                    any RF transmissions. The main contributions of this paper are:
                    (i) We conduct experimental studies to demonstrate how such
                    constellations may be formed using COTS UAVs and mmWave
                    sensors, given realistic sensing errors and hovering vibrations,
                    (ii) We develop a theoretical framework that maps a desired
                    constellation design to error and band switching time, consid-
                    ering again practical UAV movement limitations, and (iii) We
                    experimentally demonstrate jamming resilient communications
                    and validate system goodput for links formed by UAV-mounted
                    software defined radios.</p>

                <p><u>Abstract:</u> We propose AirBeam, the first complete
                    algorith-
                    mic framework and systems implementation of distributed
                    air-to-ground beamforming on a fleet of UAVs. AirBeam
                    synchronizes software defined radios (SDRs) mounted on each
                    UAV and assigns beamforming weights to ensure high levels
                    of directivity. We show through an exhaustive set of the
                    experimental studies on UAVs why this problem is difficult
                    given the continuous hovering-related fluctuations, the need
                    to ensure timely feedback from the ground receiver due to
                    the channel coherence time, and the size, weight, power and
                    cost (SWaP-C) constraints for UAVs. AirBeam addresses these
                    challenges through: (i) a channel state estimation method
                    using Gold sequences that is used for setting the suitable
                    beamforming weights, (ii) adaptively starting transmission to
                    synchronize the action of the distributed radios, (iii) a channel
                    state feedback process that exploits statistical knowledge of
                    hovering characteristics. Finally, AirBeam provides insights
                    from a systems integration viewpoint, with reconfigurable B210
                    SDRs mounted on a fleet of DJI M100 UAVs, using GnuRadio
                    running on an embedded computing host.</p>

                <p><u>Abstract:</u> Optical and thermal sensors mounted on Unmanned
                    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been successfully used to image
                    difficult-to-access regions. Nevertheless, none of these sensors
                    provide range information about the scene; and, therefore, their
                    fusion with high-resolution mm-wave radars has the potential
                    to improve the performance of the imaging system. This paper
                    presents our preliminary experimental results of a downward-
                    looking UAV system equipped with a passive optical video camera
                    and an active Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) mm-wave
                    radar sensor. The 3D imaging of the mm-wave radar is enabled
                    by collecting data through the line of motion, thus producing
                    a synthetic aperture, and by using a co-linear MIMO array
                    perpendicular to the motion trajectory. Our preliminary results
                    shows that the fused optical and mm-wave image provides shape
                    and range information, that ultimately results in an enhanced
                    imaging capability of the UAV system.
